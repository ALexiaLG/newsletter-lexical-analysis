# newsletter-lexical-analysis

This project performs a lightweight lexical analysis of SoftRobotics.org newsletter titles, focusing on what can be reliably extracted from short text. It generates two browser-native interactive visualizations: an animated ranking of the most frequent words over time, and a dynamic lexical adjacency graph linking words that appear consecutively in titles. The approach deliberately avoids heavy NLP or semantic modeling, emphasizing interpretability, minimal assumptions, and reproducibility.
